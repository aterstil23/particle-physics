# particle-physics
The motion of the particle is obtained by updating the acceleration in all axis depending on the distance of the particles of each other. Then the velocity increment in the
update by the acceleration times a small delta t. The position in all axis is increment also with the updated speed times the delta time.
There are 2 groups of particles that repell one group from the other. 
There are cohesion attraction and repulsion between the particles of a same group colored differently.
At the beginning i used an inverse square law for the attraction and repulsion of the particles and the particles just smashed into each other and repulled violent and exploding in 
every direction.
Then i tweaked the power of the inverse law so it was less than 2 so that the attraction would be weaker. And by accident i made the power of the inverse law of the repulsion 
even smaller and it seemed to work out and assume a certain cohesion between two groups of particles.
